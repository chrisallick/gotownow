I'm not kidding... please check it out.

Ok, so here is the scenario in which I will use this.  I'm on my laptop and someone sends me al ink other than email or twitter.  This link should be opened in mobile safari.  This happens to me at least once a day, but not more than 10, however, it's fucking annoying every time.

Problem: eradicated.

In this email I've attached a zip file which is a chrome-extension.  When loaded, it places an icon next to the url and when you click it it posts the current url to my server.

Now, on my cellphone (iPhone) I have a website called:

http://gotonow.herokuapp.com

and 

http://gotonow.herokuapp.com/url

if you go to the second url, it should say "error" that i cause nothing has been posted. Good! click the arrow and save that website as an app to your desktop.

Next time someone sends you link, hit the chrome extension button, done, click the app on your iphone and it will redirect you.
